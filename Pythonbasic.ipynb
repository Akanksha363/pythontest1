What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","   - Python is a High-level and Interpreted programming language known for its\n","     simplicity and readability.It is so popular due to extensive libraries and easy syntax make it popular among beginners and professionals.\n","\n","2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n","  - An interpreter in Python is a program that executes python code line-by-line\n","    converting it into machine-readable instructions.\n","\n","3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","   - Predefined keywords are reserved words that have specific meanings and\n","     cannot be used as variable names.\n","   - Used to define the syntax of the coding.\n","   - Are Predefined identifiers that control the program's flow and logic.\n","\n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","  - No,because using them as variables would cause syntax error.\n","\n","5. What is mutability in Python?\n","    - Mutability refers to an object that can be changed its value after creation.\n","    - Mutable objects,like (Lists, dictionaries and sets).\n","\n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","    - lists can be modified or updated after creation so it is mutable .\n","    - tuples can't be modified or updated after creation.\n","\n","7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","   - The \"==\" operator checks the value comparison and \"is\" to verify if they\n","     refer to the same memory location.\n","\n","8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","    - logical operators in python are used to combine conditional statements.\n","    * and-Returns True if both the condition are true.\n","    * or- Returns True if atleast one condition is true.\n","    * not-Reverses the result.\n","\n","9. What is type casting in Python?\n"," - Typecasting in Python is the process of converting one datatype to another.\n","   It can be done explicitly using functions like int(), float(),or string(),ensures compatibility between different types during operations.\n","  \n","10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","  - Implicit typecasting is performed by a python interpreter only when\n","    converting datatypes.\n","  - Explicit typecasting is performed by the programmer to manually convert one\n","    datatype to another using functions like int(), str() or float().\n","\n","11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","  - Conditional statement allows a program to make decisions based on whether a\n","    condition is true or false.\n","  - control the flow of the program.\n","\n","12. How does the elif statement work?\n"," -  The elif statement is used to check multiple conditions after an initial  \n","    if statement.\n","        x=10\n","        if x>15\n","          print(\"Greater than 15\")\n","        elif x==10\n","          print(\"Equal to 10\")\n","        else:\n","          print(\"Less than 10\")\n","\n","13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","   - A For loop is used when the number of iterations is known , while a While\n","     loop is used when the number of iterations is unknown.\n","\n","14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","  - We want to repeatedly ask a user for a valid password until they enter the\n","    correct one.\n","        password=\"\"\n","        while password!=\"secure123\":\n","          password=input(\"Enter your password:\")\n","        print(\"Password accepted!\")\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["                                              Practical Questions"],"metadata":{"id":"ss4rejojtFCP"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1.
